## LETHALSTONE

**LETHALSTONE** is a modified version of the Blackstone codebase that supports prior forks which've added greater customization options, but eschews the codebase's heavily traditionalist and outdated approach towards builds and character creation.

## Core Design Differences

- SHYLOCK has been renamed to MIDAS.
- Certain insidious references to *heavily* unwanted ideology have been scrubbed from the game's map and sprite files
- All ERP-related mechanics (the infamous panel, defiant status, etc) have been removed and will not be returning under any circumstances.
- Pronouns are decoupled from a given sprite's bodytype, and gender-neutral pronouns will be added.
- Gender-based stat bonuses are removed and instead presented as 'statpacks' for characters to pick during chargen as archetypes (such as muscular for +2 STR and -2 INT, intelligent for +2 INT and -2 CON, etc)
